# 🚀 Welcome to My First GitHub Repo

Hi! I'm Akanksha – a Computer Science Engineering student at ITER, SOA University.

This is my very first GitHub repository! 🌱  
I'll be using this space to track my coding journey, learn Java, DSA, Web Dev & more.

Stay tuned for beginner projects, study logs, and code experiments 💻✨
